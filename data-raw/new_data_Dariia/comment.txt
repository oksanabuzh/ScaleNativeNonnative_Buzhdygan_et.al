The main file is 'non_native_species_update' - a new list.

Two others are
 'non_native_species_desicion' - file which can potentially be used as a supplement, with all sources used to estimate status. 

The sources are listed there, and we do not need to keep all of these references in the main paper text.
and 'non_native_species_changes' - just for you if you want to see how many species are changed (with new and old status, old means the previous version). I found that a few species were missed, and also I changed a few other species to native based on sources and from neophytes to archaeophytes.

Best wishes,
